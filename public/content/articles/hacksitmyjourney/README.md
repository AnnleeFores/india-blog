## Time of Fear:

It was an incident of the previous year(2019), One day I was checking my emails and I found one email from GitHub. When I scroll that email there was a link to a post about hack club. Before that, I didn’t know anything about the Hack Club. Then I read about it and it motivated me to apply for the leader of such an awesome group. So I started to fill that form and it took 2 hours for me to fill that.

Then I took two of my friends Nilavya Das and Ishan Bagchi as the Co-lead. After applying I was very nervous as I was never a leader of any group before and if my application was rejected then it also would be very painful for me. But my luck shined and

I got one email from Hack Club that said they selected my proposal and now there was one interview round. So now I got scared as I didn’t have any experience of giving an interview before. But when I gave the interview, as the interviewer was very friendly and helpful so it was going great for me.

He asked me some questions about my ideas and how I teach them and after giving answers he told me that I have to organize our first meetup. I was very happy as I cleared the interview.

## First Two events - Open Source and GitHub:

Now, we were going to conduct our first meetup. In the first session, I told about the Hack Club and its mission. After that, I took one session on Git and GitHub. As it is my first event which I took, I was a little bit nervous but in the end, all the things were done right.

After that, we met another day for GitHub and Open Source again. That time I was fully ready to take that event and teach all the basic topics and open source concepts. This time we were going blazing fast and all the members were very eager to learn and build projects there.

## The Dark Time

We had many plans to execute after the first two events, but then the pandemic started and we were unable to execute any of our plans. As other groups and people are affected by the pandemic our Hack Club SIT is not an exception to that. We lost all connections with other members. The group was in very bad condition. No members were active and we also didn’t do anything at that time. At that point in time, I once thought that we came to an end and our club was going to be a dead community.

## Ray of Hope

After some months at the end of August, I and my co-leads had one idea. Let’s take a one-month long competition on open-source contribution. At this point in time, many students also forgot about Hack Club SIT.

We then started executing our plans. We created and have taken some projects and told the creators to make some issues in their projects. After that, all the 27 contributors started to do their contribution. Out of them some of them made decent contributions and we gave some stickers to them. This event was long and executed well.

At this point in time, we thought maybe if we take online sessions we can also create a decent impact also.

## New Beginnings

Some days later, my juniors came to me and told me that they were going to be active and they wanted to learn and wanted to improve their skills. I was so happy to see their eagerness to learn and make something good. So we made one core team to plan our events and other tasks. And at that time we were finding the problems.

Then we found that many students didn’t know what were the different things they can do in computer science engineering. So we took one event with 6 speakers(specialists in different fields) about what is engineering and what are the different parts of it. In this event, we talk about web development, app development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and competitive programming.

As Hack Club gave us Zoom pro. We were using it to take this event. We got an amazing response from the attendees. We also have one youtube channel. This was our first online event link
