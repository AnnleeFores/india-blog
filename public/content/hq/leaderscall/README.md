We have been doing monthly leaders call with leaders from India.
The leaders shared how different clubs operated and asked their doubts.

The purpose of the call was to:

1. To understand the need of the leaders
2. To provide them a platform to connect and collaborate
3. To discuss how they can grow their community
4. To share tips to keep their community engaged

The feedback from the call was amazing and we are planning to expand this initiative to all over asia, stay tuned.
