Hello everyone! I am excited to tell you that the Hack Box team has now shifted the Hack Box from **development to the Beta phase!**

The product development has been like a roller-coaster ride and it was one of the best projects we have ever worked on! We are now going to proceed with its testing via some of our beta testers.
If you don’t know what Hack Box is then do consider visiting our [website](https://hackstore.hackclub.com/) and our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hackclub/hackstore).

It aims to bring the power of the internet to the most remote parts of the world and make learning accessible and fun for everyone. The product has suffered from a lot of delays because _the pandemic made it hard to test it_ but now finally we are going to shift it into Beta Phase.

We are hoping for the best possible outcomes for its beta phase. We are always open to suggestions so reach out to us on
